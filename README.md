- 👋 Hi, I’m @WysteriaAce. Please call me Val!
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, statistical research regarding public health or environmental sciences (specifically GIS), and music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to combine mathematics, statistics, data analytics, and actuarial sciences so that I can conduct research to help minimize risks in health insurances.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing much yet. Personally, I am a newbie to Github, so I am not sure how to go about this. However, once I am more comfortable, I will be looking to collaborate with others on statistical research and simple learning experiences if possible. I hope to go far after that, so fingers crossed!
- 📫 How to reach me: I am always available on Discord at ValkyrieAce#6957.
